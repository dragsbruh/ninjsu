# NinJSu - Documentation

> Pronounced Ninjutsu \
> Uses namespace `nin`

## About

NinJSu is a JavaScript library designed to facilitate the development of cross-platform games with maximum compatibility. It was created to provide you with extensive control over your game, without including fancy GUI editors.

NinJSu draws inspiration from several high-level game frameworks, such as [pygame](https://pygame.org/) and [raylib](https://raylib.com).

## Documentation

This documentation provides a brief guide on installation and usage. Please note that the setup described here is based on what we consider to be a good NinJSu setup.

### Requirements

To develop games with NinJSu, you'll need the following:

- A browser that supports WebGL to preview your game. This includes all browsers except for Internet Explorer (IE).
- A code editor to create your game.

To play games created with NinJSu, you only need a browser that supports WebGL.

### Installation

To "install" NinJSu, follow these steps:

1. Download `nin.js` and `nin.css` from `dist/` folder over [here](https://github.com/dragsbruh/ninjsu).
2. Place these files in your project directory.
3. Import them in your HTML file.

__NOTE__: Make sure to import `nin.js` before your main JavaScript file.

__NOTE__: While `nin.css` is not essential, it enhances the appearance of the game canvas.

### Usage

_(Usage instructions will be updated when library reaches beta. Until then refer to examples)_
